# CANN-Models
Used to play around with CANN models for different datasets.

Already added a small reproduction (with some changes/omissons) of the work represented from https://www.actuarialdatascience.org/ADS-Tutorials/.
Busy with applying same theory to an example of Belgian MTPL insurance.

When I have time, there will be codes for CANN on an MTPL and workers' compensation dataset. 
An extension will be to see whether neural networks can be combined with Lee-Carter to make mortality projections for the Belgian population.
