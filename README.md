# CANN-Models
Used to play around with CANN models for different datasets.

Currently, nothing is added, since I have no time yet to start on this project.

When I have time, there will be codes for CANN on an MTPL and workers' compensation dataset. 
An extension will be to see whether neural networks can be combined with Lee-Carter to make mortality projections for the Belgian population.
